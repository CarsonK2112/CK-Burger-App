In this app I attempted to create a burgers-handlebars app following the guidelines in the instructions. Unfortunately, I came just short of achieving that. I cannot get the burgers that already populate the schema to show up, nor can I get the proper values to show up on the screen that is populated with buttons.

I came as close as I could, what appears to be malfunctioning is the interaction of handlebars with other parts of the app as well as the burger_controller and burger.js in the public file possibly having the wrong vars. Also, I am not sure if I set up the schema correctly and perhaps should have added another category.

I submit this for review.
